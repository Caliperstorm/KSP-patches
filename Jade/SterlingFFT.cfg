// Tweaks "Sterling Engines: Fusion" to integrate better with Far Future Technologies.

// Specifically, it removes the Sterling Discovery engine (reduntant) and re-specs the ICF drives.
// They now run on D-He3 instead of FusionPellets, have nerfed thrust, and no longer have an integrated reactor.
// ICF drives are also moved to a more appropriate tech node. 

// This does make the Sterling ICF drives more or less a direct upgrade over the FFT ICF, but if you use my fusion fuel patch the FFT ICF still has a place as an economy D-D drive.
// Compared to the FFT Z-Pinch, the Sterling ICF has a greater ISP, but weaker thrust and cannot use afterburners.
