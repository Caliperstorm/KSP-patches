	@description = The Nodal Realms Explorer is a revolutionary new drive system, capable of both shifting craft through space at incredible speeds and piercing into hyperspace to near-instantly transport ships to distant stars. It has the potential to make all interstellar and most interplanetary drives obsolete, though the cost of installing an NRE on a ship can be prohibitive. It is powered by an integrated hydrogen fusion reactor, which requires startup charging. This engine supports a maximum vessel mass of 90t.
