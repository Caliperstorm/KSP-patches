It has the potential to make all interstellar and most interplanetary drives obsolete, though the cost of installing an NRE on a ship can be prohibitive. It is powered by an integrated hydrogen fusion reactor, which requires startup charging. This engine supports a maximum vessel mass of 90t, and consumes 0.9t of hydrogen per light-year.
