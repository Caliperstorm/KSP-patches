	@description = The Orbit Portal Technologies OBH-3 Pulsed Kugelblitz Drive may be the most complicated device ever concieved by Kerbalkind. Created to sidestep the (literally) astronomical cost of 3He, the OBH converts ordinary hydrogen directly into energy using every arcane law of physics OPT engineers could find. The first stage is an array of gamma-ray lasers connected to vaccum-fluctuation batteries, which stores an immense electric charge from external reactor(s), and discharges it instantly at a single point. That point is arranged to be directly in the path of a proton burst, and the resulting quantum singularity absorbs these protons, and then decays into a gamma-ray burst. This burst is focused back onto the reaction point, creating another singularity which absorbs another proton burst, and so on. Quickly these pulses develop into a firestorm of black holes popping into and out of existance behind the spacecraft, consuming hydrogen and pushing the ship forward with its radiation. While this system obviously scales down better than a full-on primordial black hole thruster, it is also inherently less efficiant - A larger portion of the hydrogen is wasted, and less of the gamma-rays are properly redirected.
