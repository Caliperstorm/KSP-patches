// Buffs Karbonite+ fusion engines to be competitive with torch drives

// The base stats leave fusion engines with a strange neiche. They (usually) have greater thrust than similar-sized torch drives, but lower ISP and don't work in atmosphere
// They also consume more of the rare and expensive Karborundum
// As a result, there are almost no situations where they are worth using

// This patch instead converts them into low thrust, ultra-high ISP orbital engines. If the torch drive is a super-powered chemical rocket, the fusion drive is an ion engine
// They are now so efficiant, they are viable for interstellar travel!
// Burns will be very long, however. Persistant Thrust is recommended

	@description = Originally a scaled down lab demo, this engine is the little brother of the KFD-250 Fusion Drive.  Using high-powered lasers to implode Karborundum pellets and riding the resulting wave of expanding fusion plasma, this engine achieves incredible efficiency, at the cost of low thrust.  Note that due to the power requirements, a nuclear reactor will be needed.
