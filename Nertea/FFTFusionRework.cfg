// This set of patches is designed to re-configure the fuels that Far Future Technologies fusion engines and reactors use.
// FFT engines are based on a number of theoretical designs that use a variety of fuels, but in-game they are all flattened to universally use D-He3 (other than the Impulse, which can also use D-D).
// Now, they all use what they did in their original papers.
// Some engines suffer in performance from this change, but that is likely worth it for saving the cost of He3.

// As a minor limitation, D-T fusion modes will consume lithium instead of tritium, simulating a closed breeding fuel cycle.
// This is because designs would otherwise need to deal with tritium decay and new tank configurations.
// FFT already has lithium tanks, so this method is more convinent.

// ENGINES
// -------



// MIF
// The 'Impulse' magneto-inertial engine is based on a NIAC proposal by John Slough, "The Fusion Driven Rocket: Nuclear Propulsion through Direct Conversion of Fusion Energy"
// The study proposed using D-T, which in this system is identical to the deuterium + lithium mode
// So, the only change is the removal of the D-He3 mode, which is not based on the original paper

// DISCOVERY MCF
// No changes, since it is based on the "Discovery II" design which originally used D-He3



// MAGNETIC MIRROR
// This engine is based on the "Gasdynamic Fusion Propulsion System for Space Exploration" by Terry Kammash and Myoung-Jae Lee
// The paper used D-T, so we must switch this engine to use deuterium + lithium

// Math:
// D:T are 1:1 in moles
// For each mole of tritium, you need 1 mole of lithium (either A = 6 or 7)
// So D:Li mass ratio is 2.014:6.94 -> 1:3.4459
// CRP deut density is 0.0001624, lithium is 0.000534 (Mg/ksp unit)
// So D:Li unit ratio is 1:1.048

// MCF AEROSPIKE
// No changes, since it is a modified Discovery engine, and using an aneutronic reaction makes sense for a launch thruster (ground safety)



// ICF
// The 'Hammertong' ICF engine is based on Roderick A. Hyde's paper "A Laser-Fusion Rocket for Interplanetary Propulsion"
// The original design used D-D, with negligible tritium salting. 
// It also used deuterium as an inert afterburning material, but since this offers no advantage over the hydrogen used by other afterburners, I've swapped it out
// The ISP ends up quite a bit lower, so for interstellar travel I'd recommend using Sterling System's D-He3 ICF thruster instead

// Z-PINCH
// I think this engine is based on the papers "Advanced Space Propulsion Based on the Flow-Stabilized Z-Pinch Fusion Concept" and "Sustained neutron production from a sheared-flow stabilized Z-pinch"
// As far as I can tell both of these are designed for D-He3 (at least one also supports p-B11, but that's outside of our scope)
// So, no changes are needed



// REACTORS
// --------

// By default, FFT reactors can run on D-D for half power, or D-He3 for full power
// I'm going to leave this configuration, because it incentivises finding He3 as a high-quality fuel and probably makes sense, given the energy loss to neutrons in a non-breeding D-D reactor
// So, all that needs to be done is to add two new fusion modes 
// - One for D-T, which should be more powerful than D-D (lower Lawson criterion) but not as powerful as D-He3 (neutron loss)
// - And one for D-D -> He3, because it is probably the most practical way of obtaining He3 IRL and it actually takes extra effort to not produce it (look up the catalytic D-D cycle for details)
