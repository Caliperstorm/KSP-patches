// Patch by Caliperstorm

// This patch converts the FFT 'Frisbee' engine from plasma-core antimatter to beam-core, by adjusting the matter-antimatter ratio to 1:1 (by mass) and increasing ISP.
// This is similar to Patch Emporium's changes, but keeping FFT's antimatter density.
// In all, this makes the engine more viable for ISVs, but more costly to fuel with antimatter for lower dVs.
// (Specifically, the antimatter mass fraction will be higher for dVs below 32,870 km/s (~0.11c), but lower afterwards)
