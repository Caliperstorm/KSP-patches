	@description = The Anti Entropy Thermo-Nullifier is a mysterious, physics-breaking device that seems to remove heat from the universe when activated. By all known rules of thermodynamics, this should be impossible. Scientists theorize that it might work by dumping heat into a parallel universe, or ambient dark matter, or any number of other explanations. Regardless, it does work, and is quite useful for those who prefer not to have visible radiators on their ships.
